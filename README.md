## We address the following questions

* **Aim 1)**: How do waterfowl impoundment-specific characteristics influence nitrogen cycling transformations? 

* **Aim 2)**: How do storm events influence nitrogen dynamics in waterfowl impoundments? 

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:** An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Ariane Peralta and Regina Bledsoe containing functions used in analysis of soil and microbial sequence data.

* **bin:** 
	* *RainCloudPlots*: An R script written by Dr. Micah Allen. Visit https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots.

* **data:** Files associated with soil and nitrogen transformations rates data sets. 

* **figures:** Figures (of nitrogen cycling rates) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.
