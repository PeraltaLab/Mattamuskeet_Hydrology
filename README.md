"Wetland conditions differentially influence nitrogen processing within waterfowl impoundments" (manuscription in revision)

This study was conducted at the long-term fertilization and mowing experiment at West Research Campus, East Carolina University.

This repository contains open-source code, data, & text files.

For information regarding the project, please visit: [update with publication information]

## We address the following questions

* **Aim)**: How do waterfowl impoundment-specific characteristics influence N cycling transformations? 

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:**: An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Ariane Peralta and Regina Bledsoe containing functions used in analysis of soil and microbial sequence data.

* **bin:** 
	* *RainCloudPlots*: An R script written by Dr. Micah Allen. Visit https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots.

* **data:**: Files associated with soil and nitrogen transformations rates data sets. 

* **figures:**: Figures (of nitrogen cycling rates) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.
